<p>to answer this we first need to understand what is <strong>general purpose computer</strong> which simply means computers that solve many problems by just swapping it's software.
when we come to <strong>embedded systems</strong> it's a small system that is embedded in a bigger system to solve a specific problem, this system have both hardware and software componenet.</p>

<hr>

<p>you didn't get it, it's cool i will mention an examples i got from wiki i find it good </p>

<p><strong>A controller **is embedded in an elevator and tells the motor to move the elevator to different floors based on buttons that are pushed.</strong> A decoder** is embedded in a satellite television set-top box to read a signal from the dish and send something that a TV understands. Often this type of system must do its work in a specific amount of time. This is called <em><strong>real-time computing</strong></em>. If a set-top box got interrupted to do another task, you would see a bad picture on the TV, for example. A general purpose computer will often have short pauses while it does something else, it is not real-time.</p>

<p>so from that we understand that not only we have to make it do a specific function but also in a specific amount of time or it will produce performance issues.</p>

<ul>
<li>Embedded system are designed to do a specific task not like general purpose computers as i mention before. </li>
<li>They don't look like a computer for sure, <strong>(there may not be a full monitor or a keyboard)</strong>
</li>
<li>and also as i mention before it has to do things in real time (spicific time to do certain task)</li>
<li>They must be safe (don't kill someone). </li>
<li>High performance ( you don't want a TV to start working in two hours by then your favourite show is over).</li>
<li>It uses a special operating system (or sometimes a very small home-made OS) that helps meet these requirements called a real-time operating system, or RTOS.
*The program instructions written for embedded systems are referred to as firmware, and are stored in read-only memory or flash memory chips. They run with limited computer hardware resources: little memory, small or non-existent keyboard and/or screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>last but not least Embedded systems are not always standalone devices. Sometimes they are built as a set, like the various parts of a car - the radio, the throttle control, the pollution control, etc.  Sometimes they can communicate to the internet or a cell-phone network and they may have a USB reader or other connections.</p>
