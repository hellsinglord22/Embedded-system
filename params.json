{"name":"Embedded-system","tagline":"This descripe the basics of embedded system and give u a head start to start using this system to create many amazing staff ","body":"# Embedded system \r\n## What is **Embedded system** ? \r\nto answer this we first need to understand what is **general purpose computer** which simply means computers that solve many problems by just swapping it's software.\r\nwhen we come to **embedded systems** it's a small system that is embedded in a bigger system to solve a specific problem, this system have both hardware and software componenet.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nyou didn't get it, it's cool i will mention an examples i got from wiki i find it good \r\n\r\n**A controller **is embedded in an elevator and tells the motor to move the elevator to different floors based on buttons that are pushed.** A decoder** is embedded in a satellite television set-top box to read a signal from the dish and send something that a TV understands. Often this type of system must do its work in a specific amount of time. This is called _**real-time computing**_. If a set-top box got interrupted to do another task, you would see a bad picture on the TV, for example. A general purpose computer will often have short pauses while it does something else, it is not real-time.\r\n\r\nso from that we understand that not only we have to make it do a specific function but also in a specific amount of time or it will produce performance issues.\r\n\r\n[More examples on embedded system application to give you more ideas ](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system#Examples_of_embedded_systems)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Now lets mention the main charactristic of the embedded system \r\n* Embedded system are designed to do a specific task not like general purpose computers as i mention before. \r\n* They don't look like a computer for sure, **(there may not be a full monitor or a keyboard)**\r\n* and also as i mention before it has to do things in real time (spicific time to do certain task)\r\n* They must be safe (don't kill someone). \r\n* High performance ( you don't want a TV to start working in two hours by then your favourite show is over).\r\n* It uses a special operating system (or sometimes a very small home-made OS) that helps meet these requirements called a real-time operating system, or RTOS.\r\n*The program instructions written for embedded systems are referred to as firmware, and are stored in read-only memory or flash memory chips. They run with limited computer hardware resources: little memory, small or non-existent keyboard and/or screen.\r\n\r\nlast but not least Embedded systems are not always standalone devices. Sometimes they are built as a set, like the various parts of a car - the radio, the throttle control, the pollution control, etc.  Sometimes they can communicate to the internet or a cell-phone network and they may have a USB reader or other connections.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
